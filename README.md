# Spotify API
A tool to search for artists and albums using the Spotify API.

This is a small project I worked on during my time at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/), where I studied from July - August 2019.

The aim of the project was to get acquainted with using APIs, particularly making AJAX requests and working with JSON data.
